# Minefield

A simple game Minefield

Implemented:

-Start and restart button

-Display mines at the beginning of the game for 5 seconds

-Game process with clearing field cells

-Explosion of mines when hitting them

-Win when the field is completely cleared and only mines remain on it

-Changing the number of cells and mines when editing the "COMPLEXITY" parameter (Sorry, but I did not display this as buttons inside the game)
